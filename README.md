I created this integration because I've owned a Smart Oil Gauge for years and wanted it's data in Home Assistant.
Over the years there were some scraper options for some data but I didn't really care for that.
If you find this useful, great, I don't want any donations, just say Thanks :)
I've been testing this integration this winter, went thru a few versions working out any bugs, is stable as of the latest HA release.
Enjoy :)
